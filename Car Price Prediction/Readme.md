# Car Price Prediction Web App

## Overview

This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning application that predicts the selling price of a used car based on various features such as year, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and ownership.

The model is deployed as an interactive web application using **Streamlit**, allowing users to input car details and get real-time price predictions.
